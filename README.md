# pytorch
I am learning pytorch and hence trying out different examples provided in the tutorial. I will keep on adding as I try out new examples.

Simple 2 layer feedforward network trained on multivarite normal distribution

Added word2vec.. specify folder containing all the documents.. content must be put in a single line. uses stochastic gradient descent...

Classifying names with 2 layer perceptron and character level RNN

Added graph convolution network proposed by thomas kiff et. al. (implementation of train-test split incomplete)

VAE - variational autoencoder that generates new words using charater-level RNNs... need to train on larger data to get meaningful results..

Deep Q network (DQN) added..
